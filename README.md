Hi, I'm Kirk!

I get excited about code and dev tooling in general! If you've run into me on github, it's probably related to [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/), where I'm on [the maintenance team](https://typescript-eslint.io/maintenance/team).

You can reach out to me directly

- on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirk-waiblinger-941374141/)

Looking forward to collaborating!
